## Authentication

<Note>
  All the API’s utilize Basic authentication, where you need to include the Authorization header in your HTTPS requests. The header value should be in the format Basic Base64 encode using the relevant clientID and SecretKey.
</Note>

Example : Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=

To authenticate, you’ll require the following credentials:

clientID: Your unique account identifier.
SecretKey: Your account password, used for sending API requests.
Ensure to replace CLIENTID and SECRETKEY with your actual client ID and secret key provided by the API provider. Additionally, fill in the necessary information within the request body JSON structure.

```cURL
"header": [
  {
    "Authorization": Basic[]
  }
]
```
